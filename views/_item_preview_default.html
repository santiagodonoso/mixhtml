            On the left site of this page, you will see boxes with numbers. Imagine each
            box is an item, property, product, user, etc. You would like to get a quick
            overview of that item and also you may want to copy the link and send it to a friend.
            Click on any box and you will see how the single page app loads the respective data,
            sets the title of the page, and also changes the URL. Amazing! All done with just HTML.
            And yes, you can navigate the page by clicking on the back or forward buttons as well.

            This page is built with <span class="text-orange-500 font-bold">mixhtml</span>. It is a
            complete single page app with server side rendering, searh engine optimized (SEO) and does not use any
            fancy over-complicated framework, nor does it use Nodejs. This library can be
            used with any back-end language out of the box.
